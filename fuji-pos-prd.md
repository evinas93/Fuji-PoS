- Faster, more accurate order processing
- Real-time sales and inventory tracking
- Automated financial calculations and reporting
- Data-driven insights for business optimization
- Enhanced customer experience through reduced wait times

### 2.3 Target Users

- **Primary Users:**
  - Servers (order taking and payment processing)
  - Cashiers (payment processing and receipt generation)
  - Kitchen Staff (order viewing and preparation tracking)
  - Managers (reporting, analytics, and system administration)
- **Secondary Users:**
  - Restaurant Owners (business analytics and financial reporting)
